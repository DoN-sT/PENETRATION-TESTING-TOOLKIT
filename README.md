*** Task Discription***

I'm excited to share a versatile and efficient tool kit designed to streamline essential tasks such as port scanning and file integrity checking. 

Key Features:
***Port Scanner :
           The tool kit includes a robust port scanning feature that identifies open ports on a target system. You simply need to input a domain name, and our program will resolve it to an IP address and scan for commonly used ports. This allows for quick network diagnostics and security analysis.

***File Integrity Checker: 
          This module ensures the integrity of your files by performing thorough checks to detect any unauthorized changes or corruption.

 
Upon launching the tool, users are greeted with a friendly interface that presents two options:

1.Conduct a Port Scan

2.Perform a File Integrity Check

Based on the selected operation, the program guides the user through a seamless and efficient workflow.
